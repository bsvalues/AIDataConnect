Build a Full-Stack AI LLM-Powered Statistical Dashboard and Reporting Tool with the following core features:

Dynamic Roadmap & Progress Tracking

Establish a clear, iterative roadmap (Kanban or Gantt) that tracks the full workflow—from initial data ingestion to final AI-powered insights.
Integrate with existing project management tools (Trello, Jira, etc.) if needed.
Ensure each milestone focuses on delivering tangible features: data connectors, dashboards, AI modules, or reporting features.
Modular File & Folder Structure

Create separate folders for frontend, backend, ai_models, data_connectors, dashboard_components, LLM_plugins, tests, and docs.
Each folder should be drop-in/replaceable without affecting other parts of the system (truly modular design).
Maintain a plugin_manager or “Pluggy-like” system so new components or connectors can be added with minimal code changes.
Visual Development Environment with Live Coding & Hot Reloading

Set up Docker Compose (or an equivalent) to ensure a consistent dev environment for all team members.
Enable hot reloading for both frontend and backend to shorten the feedback loop while building the dashboard interface and data connectors.
Intelligent Troubleshooting & Continuous Testing

Implement AI-driven logging and monitoring to identify anomalies in data ingestion, ETL jobs, or user interactions with the dashboard.
Auto-generate suggestions for common data issues (e.g., missing columns, corrupted data, outliers).
Build continuous integration pipelines that run end-to-end tests, verifying that all components (from data source to AI model output) work seamlessly.
Comprehensive Documentation

Use OpenAPI/Swagger to document REST endpoints for data ingestion, transformation, and retrieval.
Provide robust architectural diagrams showing how data flows from external sources through the Modular Connection tool, into the AI layer, and finally into the dashboards/reports.
Include a “Developer Handbook” explaining how to:
Add new data connectors in data_connectors
Integrate new AI or LLM features in ai_models or LLM_plugins
Deploy and test the entire system locally or in the cloud
Modular, Plug-and-Play Architecture (Including the Modular Connection Tool)

Modular Connection:
Create an abstraction layer (e.g., a universal adapter) that can connect to various data sources (SQL/NoSQL databases, CSV, third-party APIs).
Enable dynamic loading/unloading or upgrading of connectors (e.g., new connectors for ERP systems) without downtime.
Plugin Manager:
Allow the backend or AI layer to seamlessly accept new modules for specialized data transformations or domain-specific reporting.
LLM & AI Agent Playground

Develop an Insights Engine that uses LLMs to:
Generate narrative summaries of key metrics or trends.
Answer natural language queries about the data (“What is the YoY growth rate in Q2?”).
Provide a testing UI or notebook where teams can fine-tune or experiment with AI models on real or synthetic data.
Optionally integrate a vector database (FAISS, Milvus, Weaviate) for advanced retrieval or semantic search over large datasets.
Packaged Deployment (Cloud, On-Prem, or Hybrid)

Deliver Docker images (and optional Helm charts) that package the entire stack for easy deployment.
Support multi-environment setups (dev, staging, production) with minimal configuration overhead.
Include scripts for auto-scaling and load balancing in Kubernetes if large-scale usage is anticipated.
AI-Driven Testing, Continuous Feedback & Self-Learning Mechanisms

Automate tests that ensure dashboards are accurate and AI insights are valid.
Collect user feedback on the clarity and accuracy of AI-driven recommendations or summaries.
Allow the LLM or AI engine to improve its contextual understanding over time (e.g., building domain-specific dictionaries or refining prompts based on user corrections).
Usage & Implementation Flow
Project Kickoff & Roadmap

Spin up a Trello/Jira board with tasks labeled by module (Data Connectors, Dashboards, AI Models, etc.).
Define sprints or iterations, each delivering a functional slice of the product.
Scaffolding the Architecture

Generate the folder structure as defined in Module 2.
Set up Docker Compose or a similar tool for multi-container orchestration (frontend, backend, database, AI services).
Early Prototyping

Implement a minimal data connector and a basic dashboard to confirm end-to-end connectivity.
Integrate a simple AI inference endpoint to test LLM-driven summaries or insights on sample data.
Iterative Enhancements

Add more data connectors (Modular Connection).
Expand the dashboards with interactive charts (via libraries like D3, Chart.js, or Plotly).
Continually improve the LLM-based insights engine and natural language query capabilities.
Testing & Troubleshooting

Use your AI-driven logging/monitoring to refine data ingestion and transformation flows.
Update tests whenever adding new data connectors or LLM plugins to ensure nothing breaks.
Deployment & Feedback Loops

Deploy using the provided Docker/Helm packages, possibly in a staging environment for user testing.
Collect user feedback on both the dashboards and the AI-driven insights.
Apply continuous learning to refine the LLM’s responses or the system’s architecture.
Documentation & Long-Term Maintenance

Keep the docs folder updated with any new connectors, metrics, or AI features.
Plan for scaling strategies—both horizontally for more users/data and vertically for more complex analytics/AI tasks.

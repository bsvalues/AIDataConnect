## Deployment Steps

1. **Pre-Deployment**
   - Run final test suite
   - Create database backup
   - Notify stakeholders of upcoming deployment
   - Freeze code changes

2. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Verify functionality in staging
   - Run performance tests in staging
   - Deploy to production environment
   - Verify functionality in production

3. **Post-Deployment**
   - Monitor application performance and errors
   - Check system resource utilization
   - Verify all integrations are working
   - Begin user acceptance testing

## Rollback Plan

**Triggering Criteria**
- Critical bug affecting core functionality

# Deployment Verification Test Plan

## Overview
This verification plan outlines the systematic approach to validate that the deployed application meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

## Test Environment
- **Production Mirror**: A staging environment that mirrors production settings
- **Test Data**: Non-sensitive, representative test data
- **Tools**: Browser developer tools, API testing tools, performance monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria
- All critical functionality (Authentication, File Management, Data Sources, Pipelines) passes verification
- Performance meets or exceeds specified thresholds
- No critical or high security vulnerabilities present
- Error handling provides appropriate user feedback
- Logging captures necessary information for troubleshooting

## Verification Sign-Off
Upon successful completion of all verification tests, the deployment will be officially signed off for production use.

## Post-Verification Monitoring
After verification, the following will be monitored for 48 hours:
- Application error rates
- API response times
- User sessions and activity
- Server resource utilization
- Database performance

Any anomalies will be investigated immediately to ensure long-term stability.

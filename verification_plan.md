# RAG Drive FTP Hub Verification Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive verification plan for the RAG Drive FTP Hub application before production deployment. It covers various testing strategies, acceptance criteria, and verification steps to ensure the application meets all requirements and quality standards.

## Test Environment Setup

1. **Staging Environment**

   - Network conditions similar to production

2. **Test Data**
   - Sample files of various formats (PDF, TXT, DOCX, CSV, etc.)
   - Test user accounts with different permission levels
   - Artificially large datasets to test performance under load

3. **Monitoring Tools**
   - Logging configured at appropriate levels
   - Performance monitoring dashboard enabled
   - Error tracking and alerting set up

#### Usability Testing

| User Journey | Testing Approach | Acceptance Criteria |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| New User Onboarding | Task completion testing | Users can complete registration and first upload within 5 minutes |
| Regular Operations | User satisfaction surveys | Average task completion rate >90%, satisfaction score >4/5 |
| Error Recovery | Error induction and recovery | Users can understand error messages and recover from errors |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance | Application meets all WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria |

### 3. Integration Testing

| Integration Point | Test Cases | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------------------|------------|---------------------|
| External APIs | Authentication, rate limiting, error handling | All API interactions handle success and error cases correctly |
| Database | CRUD operations, transaction integrity, migration testing | Data integrity maintained under all conditions |
| File Storage | Upload/download, access control, error conditions | Files stored and retrieved correctly with proper permissions |
| FTP Server | Protocol compliance, authentication, large file handling | FTP operations work correctly for all client types |

### 4. Deployment Testing

| Aspect | Testing Approach | Acceptance Criteria |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Installation | Fresh installation, upgrade from previous version | Installation completes without errors, data preserved during upgrades |
| Configuration | Test with different environment configurations | Application works correctly with all supported configurations |
| Backup & Restore | Simulate failures, perform restores | System can be restored to working state within RTO/RPO targets |
| Monitoring | Test alerting, log rotation, metric collection | All monitoring systems correctly capture application state |

## Verification Process

### Pre-Deployment Verification

1. **Code Review**
   - Static code analysis (linting, type checking)
   - Manual peer review of all code changes
   - Security-focused code review by security team

2. **Automated Testing**
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for key workflows
   - End-to-end tests for critical user journeys

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Run performance audit script
   - Implement recommended optimizations
   - Verify performance improvements with benchmark tests

4. **Database Optimization**
   - Run database optimization script
   - Review and implement schema optimizations
   - Verify query performance improvements

### Deployment Verification

1. **Deployment to Staging**
   - Execute deployment checklist
   - Verify all components are operational
   - Run smoke tests to verify basic functionality

2. **Regression Testing**
   - Execute full regression test suite
   - Verify no regressions in existing functionality
   - Check for any unexpected side effects

3. **Final Verification**
   - Run performance tests under production-like load
   - Execute security scanning and penetration tests
   - Conduct final user acceptance testing

### Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Monitoring**
   - Verify all monitoring systems are active
   - Confirm alerts are properly configured
   - Check logging is working correctly

2. **User Feedback**
   - Collect and analyze initial user feedback
   - Address any critical issues immediately
   - Plan for non-critical improvements in next release

3. **Performance Tracking**
   - Monitor actual performance metrics
   - Compare with pre-deployment baselines
   - Identify any areas for future optimization

## Exit Criteria

The verification process is considered complete and the application ready for production deployment when:

1. All automated tests pass with at least 80% code coverage
2. No critical or high-severity bugs remain open
3. Performance metrics meet or exceed acceptance criteria
4. Security testing reveals no critical or high vulnerabilities
5. User acceptance testing is completed with sign-off from product owner
6. All deployment verification steps are completed successfully

   - Error rate exceeds 5% for any critical operation
   - Security vulnerability is discovered
   - Data integrity issues are detected

2. **Rollback Procedure**
   - Execute `./scripts/rollback.sh` script
   - Verify previous version is operational
   - Notify all stakeholders of the rollback
   - Conduct root cause analysis

3. **Recovery Actions**
   - Fix identified issues in a controlled environment
   - Conduct verification tests on fixes
   - Schedule new deployment with increased monitoring
